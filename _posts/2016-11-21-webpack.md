## Introduction

4 Core Concepts

### Entry

The entry point tells webpack where to start and follows the graph of dependencies to know what to bundle.

```
module.exports = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js'
};
```

### Output

The webpack output property describes to webpack how to treat bundled code.

```
module.exports = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js'
  }
};
```

### Loaders

webpack treats every file (.css, .html, .scss, .jpg, etc.) as a module. However, webpack only understands JavaScript.

Loaders in webpack transform these files into modules as they are added to your dependency graph.

```
const config = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js'
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {test: /\.(js|jsx)$/, use: 'babel-loader'}
    ]
  }
};
```

### Plugins

Since Loaders only execute transforms on a per-file basis, plugins are most commonly used (but not limited to) performing actions and custom functionality on "compilations" or "chunks" of your bundled modules (and so much more).
